> <b> R project to create a tool that scrapes the web for data. </b>

For this project I first web scraped wikipedia to get a list of the top 100 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 over a number of years. I then used this song information in order to web scrap the Lyrics for these songs from [Genius](genius.com).

I used the lyrics to plot the frequency of the words used in the songs as well as try and detect differences in the wordchoice throughout the decades.
