# Web Scraping in R

R project to create a tool that scrapes the web for data.

For this project I first web scraped wikipedia to get a list of the top 100 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 over a number of years. I then used this song information in order to web scrap the Lyrics for these songs from (Genius)[genius.com].
